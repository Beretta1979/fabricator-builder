# REMARK: In Development!

I forked this from the fabricator project and transformed it so it can be used to build toolkits. So you can build your
toolkit through configuration, and this project will then build it for you. I waited to see if I could merge my changes
into the original project, but it appears that won't happen. So I'm making it a different project that will do the same
as the original, but as a builder, and try to keep it in sync with the features of the original. The rest of this readme
is still from the original though, I'll update everything asap.

# Fabricator builder

> _fabricate_ - to make by assembling parts or sections.

Fabricator builder is a tool for building website UI toolkits - _think ["Tiny Bootstraps, for Every Client"]
(http://daverupert.com/2013/04/responsive-deliverables/#tiny-bootstraps-for-every-client)_

It's a builder version of the [original Fabricator project](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator), which means you
create your project, add the needed configuration files and let Fabricator builder build your toolkit.
